                    transfers, such as mergers or acquisitions, your data may be transferred as part of the transaction.
                    We may also share aggregated or anonymized data that cannot be used to identify you, for analytics,
                    research, or marketing purposes. We ensure any data sharing aligns with relevant data protection

                    These include SSL encryption, secure payment gateways, firewalls, and regular security audits. All
                    transactions are processed through secure technology partners who adhere to industry standards for
                    payment security. Access to personal data is restricted to authorized personnel and systems only.
                    While we take all reasonable precautions to protect your data, no system is entirely immune from
                    cyber threats. We encourage you to choose strong passwords, log out of shared devices, and contact
                    us if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account. In the unlikely event of a data breach, we
                    will notify affected users and regulatory authorities as required by law. Your trust is important to
                    us, and we continually evaluate and improve our security practices to ensure your information is

                    account but remain inactive for more than two years, we may delete or anonymize your data unless
                    otherwise required by law. Once data is no longer needed, it is securely deleted or anonymized. You
                    may request deletion of your account and associated data at any time, and we will comply unless
                    legal obligations require otherwise. Our data retention practices are regularly reviewed to ensure

                    provided us with personal data are encouraged to contact us so we can promptly investigate and take
                    appropriate action. We strongly advise minors to seek permission from a parent or guardian before
                    providing any information online. Protecting children’s privacy is a serious responsibility, and we

                    (COPPA). Our platform is designed with privacy by default, and we take care to avoid engaging
